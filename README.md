## Neos CMS distribution of http://bratstvo-film.ru

Small promo website for the doc movie shot about the life of [The Transfiguraion Brotherhood](http://en.psmb.ru/).

Made with [Neos CMS](http://neos.io), Zurb Foundation grid and Gulp build system.
All content is editable by editors, responsive and is written with love.

Kickstarted from [our Neos boilerplate distribution](https://github.com/psmb/BolierplateDistr/) to save initial dev time.
Running in Docker containers built from [our Neos PHP7 image](https://github.com/psmb/docker-neos-bare) and deployed with Ansible script and CircleCI.

Matter of work of three days, so some bugs and glitches will go away soon, English
version will come in a few weeks, and the presented movie itself feel come online in a few months!
